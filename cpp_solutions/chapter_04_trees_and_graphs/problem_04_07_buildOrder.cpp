Chapter 04 - Problem 07 - Build Order

Problem Statement:
You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies (which is a list of pairs of projects,
where the second project is dependent on the first project). All of a project's dependencies must
be built before the project is. Find a build order that will allow the projects to be built.
If there is no valid build order, return an error.

Solution:
We first represent the projects and build dependencies as vertices and edges in a directed acyclic graph.
We then implement Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Algorithms

L ← Empty list that will contain the sorted elements
S ← Set of all nodes with no incoming edge
while S is non-empty do
    remove a node n from S
    add n to tail of L
    for each node m with an edge e from n to m do
        remove edge e from the graph
        if m has no other incoming edges then
            insert m into S
if graph has edges then
    return error   (graph has at least one cycle)
else
    return L   (a topologically sorted order)

Time complexity: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices in the graph and E is the number of edges.
V can be interpreted as the number of projects and E can be interpreted as the number of dependencies.
Space complexity: O(V)
